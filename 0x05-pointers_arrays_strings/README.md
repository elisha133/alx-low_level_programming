# 0x05. C - Pointers, arrays and strings

## Description
This repository contains solutions to various tasks related to pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language.

## Tasks

### Task 0
**File:** [0-reset_to_98.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/0-reset_to_98.c)

Write a function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to to 98.

### Task 1
**File:** [1-swap.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/1-swap.c)

Write a function that swaps the values of two integers.

### Task 2
**File:** [2-strlen.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/2-strlen.c)

Write a function that returns the length of a string.

### Task 3
**File:** [3-puts.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/3-puts.c)

Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, to stdout.

### Task 4
**File:** [4-print_rev.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/4-print_rev.c)

Write a function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.

### Task 5
**File:** [5-rev_string.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/5-rev_string.c)

Write a function that reverses a string.

### Task 6
**File:** [6-puts2.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/6-puts2.c)

Write a function that prints every other character of a string, starting with the first character, followed by a new line.

### Task 7
**File:** [7-puts_half.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/7-puts_half.c)

Write a function that prints half of a string, followed by a new line. If the number of characters is odd, it prints the last (length_of_the_string - 1) / 2 characters.

### Task 8
**File:** [8-print_array.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/8-print_array.c)

Write a function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.

### Task 9
**File:** [9-strcpy.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/9-strcpy.c)

Write a function that copies the string pointed to by src, including the terminating null byte, to the buffer pointed to by dest.

### Task 10 (Advanced)
**File:** [100-atoi.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/100-atoi.c)

Write a function that converts a string to an integer. It handles signs and returns 0 if no numbers are found in the string.

### Task 11 (Advanced)
**File:** [101-keygen.c](./0x05-pointers_arrays_strings/101-keygen.c)
